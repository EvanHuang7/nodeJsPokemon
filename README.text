# How to Run this Project

1.Start mySql server with command line "sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start" in mac terminal.

2.Open MYSQLWorkbench app and create a new connection called "pokemon" and set password to "123456789".

3.Click into "pokemon" connection, create a new schema called "pokemon" and set it to default schema.

4.Copy all "CREATE TABLE" queries in "mysql.text" file and run them in the query tab of "pokemon" schema.

5.After creating all mySql tables, we can run "npx nodemon app.js" command line to start project.
(Remember to install all necessary modules into node_modules folder by running "npm install" command line first)

6.After project is running, we go to "http://localhost:8080/" page and register 2 accounts first, 
so that we can run the rest of "INSERT" queries in "mysql.text" file to add pokemons for these 2 users latter.

7.After 2 users are registered, copy all the rest of "INSERT" queries in "mysql.text" file and run them in the query tab of "pokemon" schema.

8.After creating pokemons for these 2 users, we can create a PVP room and 2 users select same PVP room to start a PVP game.

9.Now, it's time for a PVP pokemon fight!!

10.After project is done, Remeber to shut down mySql server with command line "sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop" in mac terminal.
